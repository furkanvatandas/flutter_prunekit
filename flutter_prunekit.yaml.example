# Example configuration for flutter_prunekit
# Copy this file to flutter_prunekit.yaml in your project root

# Patterns to exclude from analysis
# Supports glob patterns (**, *, ?)
exclude:
  # Legacy code pending migration
  - 'lib/legacy/**'
  
  # Experimental features not yet integrated
  - 'lib/experimental/**'
  - '**/experimental_*.dart'
  
  # Generated code (usually auto-excluded, but can be explicit)
  - '**/*.g.dart'
  - '**/*.freezed.dart'
  - '**/*.gr.dart'
  
  # Platform-specific code that may not be used in all builds
  - 'lib/platform/web/**'
  - 'lib/platform/desktop/**'
  
  # Third-party code or vendored libraries
  - 'lib/vendor/**'
  
  # Deprecated code scheduled for removal
  - '**/deprecated_*.dart'
  - 'lib/deprecated/**'

# Custom annotations to treat as "keep unused" directives
# Classes with these annotations will never be reported as unused
ignore_annotations:
  # Standard annotation (always recognized)
  - 'keepUnused'
  
  # Common custom annotations you might use
  - 'deprecated'        # Classes marked deprecated but kept for compatibility
  - 'experimental'      # Experimental APIs not yet stable
  - 'internal'          # Internal APIs not meant for external use
  - 'visibleForTesting' # Test-only classes
  - 'doNotRemove'       # Custom marker annotation

# Examples of patterns you can use:
#
# Single file:
#   - 'lib/models/old_user.dart'
#
# All files in a directory:
#   - 'lib/widgets/legacy/**'
#
# All files matching a pattern:
#   - '**/temp_*.dart'
#   - '**/*_old.dart'
#
# Multiple directories:
#   - 'lib/a/**'
#   - 'lib/b/**'
#   - 'packages/*/lib/internal/**'
#
# File extensions:
#   - '**/*.generated.dart'
#   - '**/*.mocks.dart'

# NOTE: This config file has MEDIUM priority in the ignore hierarchy:
# 1. @keepUnused annotation (HIGHEST - always wins)
# 2. flutter_prunekit.yaml config file (MEDIUM - this file)
# 3. --exclude CLI flag (LOWEST - can be overridden by above)
#
# For temporary exclusions, prefer CLI flags:
#   dart run flutter_prunekit --exclude 'lib/temp/**'
#
# For permanent exclusions, use this config file or annotations
