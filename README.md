## Why flutter_prunekit?

`flutter_prunekit` is a static analysis companion that finds unused declarations across your Dart and Flutter projects. The analyzer inspects classes, methods, top-level functions, parameters, local variables, mixins, enums, and extensions, helping you ship faster and maintain a lean codebase.

The CLI runs fully offline, requires zero configuration to get started, and is backed by an extensive automated test suite to keep detection noise low.

## ‚ú® Key Capabilities

- **Comprehensive coverage** ‚Äì detects unused classes, enums, mixins, extensions, top-level functions, class/enum methods (instance & static), getters/setters, operators, parameters, pattern bindings, and local variables.
- **Precision-first analysis** ‚Äì over 440 automated tests guard against false positives. Lifecycle hooks (`initState`, `dispose`, etc.) and override chains are respected when `@override` annotations are present.
- **Fast single-pass traversal** ‚Äì optimized AST walking keeps run times short even on medium/large apps.
- **Flexible ignore strategies** ‚Äì use `@keepUnused`, config-driven patterns, CLI excludes, or underscores.
- **Offline & cross-platform** ‚Äì works on macOS, Linux, and Windows without talking to external services.

## üîç What It Detects

### ‚úÖ Classes & Types

- Regular and abstract classes
- Enums
- Mixins
- Named extensions (unnamed extensions are grouped per file)

### ‚úÖ Functions & Methods

- Top-level functions
- Instance and static methods (including factory constructors)
- Getters, setters, and operators
- Extension methods
- Lifecycle methods (`initState`, `dispose`, etc.) excluded automatically

### ‚úÖ Variables & Parameters

- Local variables and pattern bindings
- Function, method, and constructor parameters
- Top-level variables and constants
- Catch clause variables (opt-in)
- Write-only detection for assigned-but-never-read variables

## üîú Roadmap

- Unused field and property detection for classes
- Smarter override detection without requiring explicit `@override`
- Unused type alias (`typedef`) detection
- Incremental analysis mode for large monorepos

## üì¶ Installation

### Project (dev dependency)

```bash
dart pub add --dev flutter_prunekit
```

or manually in `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_prunekit: ^2.0.0
```

Then fetch dependencies:

```bash
dart pub get
```

### Global activation

```bash
dart pub global activate flutter_prunekit
```

## Quick Start

Analyze the default `lib/` directory:

```bash
dart run flutter_prunekit
```

If you installed globally:

```bash
flutter_prunekit
```

Add `--verbose` to see per-file progress, or `--json` to integrate with custom tooling.

## Example Output

```text
‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê Flutter Dead Code Analysis ‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê

‚ö† Found 3 unused class declarations:

Classes: 2

  lib/models/old_user.dart:12
    OldUser

  lib/widgets/legacy_button.dart:8
    LegacyButton

Enums: 1

  lib/utils/deprecated_helper.dart:5
    DeprecatedStatus

‚ö† Found 2 unused methods:

Instance Methods: 1

  UserService:
    lib/services/user_service.dart:23
      processLegacyUser

Top-Level Functions: 1

  lib/helpers/formatter.dart:45
    formatLegacyData

‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Summary ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ

  Files analyzed: 156
  Type declarations analyzed: 89
  Unused type declarations: 3
  Type usage rate: 96.6%

  Methods analyzed: 234
  Unused methods: 2
  Method usage rate: 99.1%

  Variables analyzed: 612
  Unused variables: 0
  Variable usage rate: 100.0%

  Analysis time: 2.3s
```

> **Tip:** Exit code `1` signals unused declarations were found. Perfectly clean runs exit with `0`. Partial runs with fatal warnings exit with `2`.

## Command Reference

Run `flutter_prunekit --help` to see the full list of options. Highlights:

| Flag | Purpose | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| `--path <dir>` | Analyze specific paths | Repeatable; defaults to `lib/` when omitted. |
| `--exclude <pattern>` | Glob-based ignore | Evaluated after path resolution. |
| `--include-tests` | Include `test/` files | Disabled by default. |
| `--include-generated` | Scan generated code | Intended for `.g.dart`, `.freezed.dart`, etc. |
| `--ignore-analysis-options` | Skip analyzer excludes | Useful for one-off deep scans. |
| `--only-methods` | Skip class detection | Methods & variables are still analyzed. |
| `--json` | Emit JSON report | Matches CLI formatter schema. |
| `--quiet` | Reduce console noise | Outputs only findings. |
| `--verbose` | Per-file diagnostics | Great for CI troubleshooting. |

## Configuration

The analyzer respects `analysis_options.yaml` excludes automatically. Additional configuration lives in `flutter_dead_code.yaml` at your project root.

### flutter_dead_code.yaml example

```yaml
# flutter_dead_code.yaml

exclude:
  - 'lib/legacy/**'
  - '**/generated/**'
  - '**/*.g.dart'

# Treat custom annotations as "keep" markers
ignore_annotations:
  - 'deprecated'
  - 'experimental'

# Ignore method patterns (glob syntax)
ignore_methods:
  - 'TestHelper.*'
  - '*Controller.dispose'
  - '_debug*'

# Variable & parameter patterns
ignore_variables:
  - 'debug*'
  - 'temp*'

ignore_parameters:
  - 'context'
  - '_*'

# Optional checks disabled by default
check_catch_variables: false
check_build_context_parameters: false
```

### Command-line excludes

Use `--exclude` for quick experiments:

```bash
dart run flutter_prunekit \
  --exclude 'lib/legacy/**' \
  --exclude '**/experimental_*.dart'
```

## Ignoring Intentional Usages

Some code is meant to look unused (reflection, dynamic calls, DI). Choose the approach that fits best:

1. **`@keepUnused` annotation** ‚Äì highest priority. Works on classes, methods, variables, and parameters.
2. **Configuration patterns** ‚Äì add glob patterns to `flutter_dead_code.yaml` under `ignore_methods`, `ignore_variables`, or `ignore_parameters`.
3. **Underscore convention** ‚Äì identifiers named `_` or prefixed with `_` are treated as intentionally unused.
4. **CLI excludes** ‚Äì skip entire files/folders on the command line.

Combine these methods when necessary. Verbose mode logs why declarations were ignored to help fine-tune patterns.

## Detection Notes & Limitations

- **Override chains** ‚Äì override detection relies on explicit `@override` annotations. Omitting the annotation may cause false positives.
- **Flutter lifecycle methods** ‚Äì common hooks (`initState`, `dispose`, `build`, etc.) are automatically treated as used.
- **Dynamic or reflective access** ‚Äì analyzer cannot prove usage; mark members with `@keepUnused` when accessed dynamically.
- **Unnamed extensions** ‚Äì currently grouped under a synthetic identifier per file. Prefer named extensions for granular reports.
- **Generated code** ‚Äì skipped by default. Use `--include-generated` when you want to scan generated outputs.

## CI & Automation

Add a script to your workflow to keep dead code out of main branches:

```yaml
# example GitHub Actions step
- name: Dead code audit
  run: dart run flutter_prunekit --include-generated --quiet
```

Exit code `1` will fail the job if any unused declarations remain.
